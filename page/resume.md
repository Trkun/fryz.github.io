# Education

**Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science** **2019 – 2024**

*University of Manitoba* Winnipeg, MB

# Project Experience

**AR Maintenance Model Design,** *Summer Research, University of
Manitoba* **Jun 2022 – Sept 2023**

- The project aims to design an AR model for a gearbox using Unity to simulate the component instruction, gearbox operation, and maintenance procedure of the gearbox.

- Honed technique skills using Unity to create the base model appearance with SolidWorks CAD files and develop a neat/well-organized user interface for the model with multiple functions added to the model.

- Showed great attention to detail and solid academic written skills by summarizing the project procedures and organizing the final report with sections including the methodology, findings and limitations.

**BoardGames Database Project,** *COMP 4020 Human-computer 
Interaction II* **Aug 2022 – Dec 2022**
- https://github.com/Trkun/bored-games

- The project aims to design an application on iPhone to provide recommendations and basic information on different board games.

- Demonstrated solid development skills by applying different concepts once at our projects, like the use of API and handling of error crashing.

- Enhanced team working experience as we are simulating real-life teamwork and scheduling tight deadlines.

- Displayed fast learning ability using React app and Javascript to design the final prototype.

- Exhibited great attention to detail by organizing all the outcome data and successfully holding the final presentation myself, demonstrating outstanding speech skills.

**Vertical Load Support Beam Design,** *MECH 3502 Stress Analysis &
Design* **Oct 2021 – Dec 2021**
- https://github.com/Trkun/COMP-3020

- The project aims to design a beam to support two vertical loads under
  an electric fence with the least material and the maximum deflection
  of two points where apply the vertical load will be less than 1.0 mm.

- Analyzed the given data and calculated the ideal thickness of the beam
  to satisfy the maximum deflection strengthened the data analytical
  skills.

- Determined the shape of the beam to save the material, which is an
  I-shape beam which can use the least material and bear the largest
  stress.

- Calculated the ideal dimensions of the beam and used SolidWorks to
  simulate the stress process.

# Work Experience

**Project Research Assistant April 2023 – Jun 2023**

*Jiaoda Weida* Beijing, China

- Demonstrated proficiency in optical fiber sensing products, including understanding their operating principles and effectively communicating them to stakeholders.

- Contributed to the editing and refining of project documents, such as "5 tons bridge crane industry management requirements research report" and "Analysis report on the use of 5 tons bridge crane", ensuring accuracy and clarity of technical information.

- Acquired proficiency in using SciFEA supercomputing software, actively participating in the analysis and simulation of tunnel laboratory experiments to evaluate product performance and feasibility.

- Played a key role in simulating the application of optical fiber sensing products, contributing to the development of management systems and operating procedures for 5 tons bridge cranes in tunnel laboratory environments.

**Welding Product Design Assistant Jun 2021 – Aug 2021**

*Dongfeng Machine Tool Plant Limited Company* Hubei, China

- Obtained a comprehensive knowledge of the main principles in welding lines for passenger cars and the latest technology used in wielding lines, such as spot-welding technology, aluminum alloy welding technology, etc.

- Participated in the project design of a welding line and enhanced understanding of fundamental principles and design process for mechanical design in an automatic welding line.

- Understood that most automatic welding lines are basically composed of body lines, floor lines, body side lines, and closures pipping binding stitches.

- Developed an overview picture of joint welding automatic lines of the basic structure and styles used for the leading machine factories.

**Research and Development Center Assistant Jul 2019 – Sept 2019**

*Jinhua PAUS Rubber Tire Vehicle Manufacturing Joint Stock Limited
Company* Jiangsu, China

- Demonstrated fast learning ability by proactively supporting daily
  tasks and developing a better understanding of the main principles of
  current vehicles and technologies, as well as acknowledging the
  material process procedure.

- Gained practical skills and knowledge of transport equipment design by
  participating in the project design procedure following the principles
  of product development.

- Demonstrated outstanding communication skills by collaborating with
  team members to accelerate the final secure test of the prototype of
  transport vehicles and summarized the procedure for the final report.
