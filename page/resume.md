**<span class="smallcaps">Project Experience</span>**

**AR Maintenance Model Design,** *Summer Research, University of
Manitoba* **Jun 2022 – Sept 2023**

- The project aims to design an AR model for a gearbox using Unity to simulate the component instruction, gearbox operation, and maintenance procedure of the gearbox.

- Honed technique skills using Unity to create the base model appearance with SolidWorks CAD files and develop a neat/well-organized user interface for the model with multiple functions added to the model.

- Showed great attention to detail and solid academic written skills by summarizing the project procedures and organizing the final report with sections including the methodology, findings and limitations.

**Woodchipper Speed Reduction System Design,** *MECH 3652 Machine
Design* **Mar 2022 – May 2022**

- The project aims to design a gear/belt/chain system for a woodchipper from the single combustion engineer input to output to achieve a 7:1 speed reduction.

- Demonstrated solid analytical skills by using the given data, computing the required dimensions for the system, and deciding the best material to apply to the gears.

- Enhanced excellent desktop research skills by searching the references to decide the engineering standard that will be applied to the system.

- Displayed fast learning ability using SolidWorks software to design the transmission system and simulate the operation process.

- Exhibited great attention to detail by organizing all the outcome data and rearranging the computed and refined results into the final report, demonstrating outstanding professional writing skills.

**Vertical Load Support Beam Design,** *MECH 3502 Stress Analysis &
Design* **Oct 2021 – Dec 2021**

- The project aims to design a beam to support two vertical loads under
  an electric fence with the least material and the maximum deflection
  of two points where apply the vertical load will be less than 1.0 mm.

- Analyzed the given data and calculated the ideal thickness of the beam
  to satisfy the maximum deflection strengthened the data analytical
  skills.

- Determined the shape of the beam to save the material, which is an
  I-shape beam which can use the least material and bear the largest
  stress.

- Calculated the ideal dimensions of the beam and used SolidWorks to
  simulate the stress process.
